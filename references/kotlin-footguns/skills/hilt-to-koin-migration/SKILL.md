description: "Move dependency injection from an annotation-processed compile-time framework (Hilt/Dagger) to the multiplatform runtime container (Koin) — the mechanical mapping for providers, view models and qualifiers, what happens to assisted injection, and the two failure modes the migration introduces: a graph that no longer fails at compile time, and a module definition that blocks the thread starting the container. Use when planning the migration, when a binding resolves to nothing at runtime after it, or when app start got slower afterwards."

# Migrating dependency injection to a multiplatform container

**The motive is reach, not ergonomics.** Hilt generates Android-specific code; Dagger's processor is
general JVM but is still a Java annotation processor. Neither runs against a `commonMain` source set
compiled for JVM/desktop *and* iOS, so once shared modules must be injected on more than one platform
a multiplatform runtime container is the only way to keep one wiring for all targets. Do not sell it
internally as "less boilerplate" — you trade a compile-time-verified graph for a runtime one, which
is a real cost (see the first trap).

## The mechanical mapping

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `@Module @InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class) object X` | `val xModule = module { … }` |
| `@Provides @Singleton fun provideA(b: B): A` | `single<A> { provideA(get()) }` |
| `@Binds fun bind(impl: AImpl): A` | `single<A> { AImpl(get()) }` |
| `class C @Inject constructor(d: D)` | `single { C(get()) }` — the constructor is now written out |
| unscoped `@Inject constructor` | `factory { … }` — a new instance per resolve |
| `@HiltViewModel class V @Inject constructor(…)` | `viewModel { V(get(), get()) }` |
| `@Named("x")` / a qualifier annotation | `named("x")` on the definition, `get(named("x"))` at the use site |
| `@Inject lateinit var` field injection | implement `KoinComponent`, then `val a: A by inject()` |
| `@HiltAndroidApp` / `@AndroidEntryPoint` | nothing — call `startKoin { modules(…) }` once |

Constructor injection is the part that inverts. Under the annotation processor the constructor was
the declaration; under the container the constructor is written by hand inside the definition, and
`get()` fills each parameter positionally by type:

```kotlin
// adapted — parameter lists shortened
val repositoryModule = module {
    single<AlbumRepository> { AlbumRepositoryImpl(get(), get()) }
    single<CommonRepository> { CommonRepositoryImpl(get(named(SERVICE_SCOPE)), get(), get()) }
}
```

Type the definition by the **interface** (`single<AlbumRepository>`) or a consumer asking for the
interface finds nothing — the implementation is likely `internal` anyway (`clean-arch-kmp-readiness`).
Modules are aggregated per layer behind one shared function, with a hook for the platform parts:

```kotlin
// adapted — two load calls merged, platform hook renamed
fun loadAllModules() {                                  // commonMain
    loadKoinModules(listOf(databaseModule, repositoryModule, mediaHandlerModule))
    loadPlatformModules()
}
expect fun loadPlatformModules()
```

## Assisted injection has no direct equivalent

Assisted injection existed for objects whose constructor is partly supplied by a framework — a
worker handed a context and parameters at construction. The container has no direct equivalent, so
the framework-supplied parameters stay in the constructor and only the injected one moves out:

```kotlin
// adapted — the migration route: framework parameters stay plain, the injected one moves out
class NotifyWork(
    context: Context,
    params: WorkerParameters,
) : CoroutineWorker(context, params), KoinComponent {
    private val repository: SomeRepository by inject()
}
```

That is a genuine downgrade: the dependency leaves the constructor, so a test must stand up a
container instead of passing a fake. Where *you* own the call site instead, `factory { (id: String)
-> Presenter(id, get()) }` plus `get { parametersOf(someId) }` avoids it — though this codebase's own
`factory` census (Verifying it, #2) shows it always took the first route.

## Traps

**Nothing fails at compile time any more, and the replacement check is opt-in.** The processor used
to reject a missing binding before the app ran; the container discovers it at the first resolve —
which may be a screen three taps deep, in a release build, on a user's device. A module-verification
test (`checkModules` / `verify()`, from the container's test artifact) is the replacement, and a
migration landing with no such test has quietly removed the only guarantee it had. Put it on the
migration checklist and confirm it stuck — Verifying it, #1.

**Anything blocking inside an eager definition runs when the container starts — if that module is loaded from inside `startKoin`.**
Only `startKoin` creates eager instances by default; a `loadKoinModules` call made *after* start does not, so the same definition
is harmless in one arrangement and blocks start-up in the other. The aggregation snippet above is invoked from inside the
`startKoin { }` lambda here, which is what puts this definition on the start-up path:

```kotlin
// adapted — cache type and provider renamed
single<DiskCache>(qualifier = named(PLAYER_CACHE), createdAtStart = true) {
    provideCache(
        cacheSize = runBlocking { get<SettingsManager>().maxCacheSize.first() },  // blocks start-up
        …
    )
}
```

It works, it is sometimes unavoidable when a constructor demands a plain value and the setting is a flow, and it is invisible unless
you profile start-up specifically. Keep such reads countable and off the eager path — `datastore-kmp-manager` covers the same tension from the storage side.

**Whatever must happen before the container starts has to be moved above `startKoin` explicitly.** Eagerly-created singletons
touch real resources — a database file, a lock — the instant the container starts, so a single-instance guard or a file migration
that used to sit in the first screen is already too late. Ordering is the fix, and only one platform tends to expose it.

**`named("…")` is a string, and a typo compiles.** Qualifier annotations were checked; qualifier
strings are not. Declare each as a constant in a module both sides depend on, and reference it.

**Everything becoming `single` is a silent behaviour change.** Unscoped bindings under the previous
framework produced a new instance per injection point; mapped onto `single` they get process
lifetime, and anything holding per-use state now shares it. Check that `factory` exists at all —
anchored to a **definition site** — Verifying it, #2 explains why and shows this codebase's result.

**Do not put a platform component into the container to make injection convenient.** Registering an
activity, a window or a service hands the container a reference that outlives it, so every consumer
resolves a stale one after the first recreation. Pass it as a parameter instead. View-model wiring
has its own set of these — see `koin-viewmodel-scoping-traps`.

## Verifying it

1. **The opt-in module-verification test actually exists somewhere in the migration:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "checkModules\|verify()" --include="*.kt" --include="*.kts" . --exclude-dir=build
   ```
   Pass condition: at least one hit — none means the guarantee this migration lost at compile time was never replaced. This repository has none today: a real, currently-open gap, not a demo.

2. **`factory` never appears (anchored, so a comment can't fool it), and every repository binding is typed by the interface the mapping table shows, not the concrete class:**
   ```bash
   grep -rnE '^[[:space:]]*factory(Of)?[[:space:]]*[<({]' --include="*.kt" . --exclude-dir=build
   REPO_MODULE=core/data/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/maxrave/data/di/RepositoryModule.kt   # your equivalent
   grep -c "single<[A-Za-z]*Repository>" "$REPO_MODULE"; grep -c "single {" "$REPO_MODULE"
   ```
   Pass condition: first grep empty — every binding here is `single`/`viewModel`, not `factory` — and the two counts after read 17 against 0: typed definitions only, none by concrete class.

3. **The second failure mode — a definition blocking the thread that starts the container — is countable, and none of it is new:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "runBlocking" --include="*.kt" $(find . -type d -name di -not -path "*/build/*")
   ```
   Pass condition: every hit is deliberate and already counted — here, 7, one of them the eager `createdAtStart` cache definition shown above. A hit outside that known count is the failure mode landing for real.
