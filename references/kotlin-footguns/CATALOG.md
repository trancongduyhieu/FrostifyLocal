# SimpMusic → Agent Skills — Master Catalog

> Built 2026-08-19 from 10 mining lanes (~282 raw candidates) in this folder: `raw-docs.md`, `raw-git.md`, `raw-git-deep`, `raw-code` (media/mpv/room/compose), `raw-code-gaps`, `raw-web`, `raw-blog`, `raw-core.md`, `raw-handlers.md`, `raw-ui.md`.
> Deduped to the clean set below. **Scope (owner decision 2026-08-19):** ship the *architecture / how / pattern*, NOT any specific third-party service mechanics. Everything YT-Music / Spotify / Discord / Last.fm / Tidal / SponsorBlock / AI-provider specific is CUT (listed at the end); the generic core of each was salvaged into group L with neutral wording (no service names, no real field names).
> Generality: A = fully generic as-is · B = generic after neutral rewrite · C = mostly SimpMusic-specific (generic core only).
> Vocabulary is deliberately neutral (behavioral, not low-level jargon).

2. `native-artifact-for-embedding` — a prebuilt AppImage is a PIE not a shared lib; build from source on old glibc; DT_RPATH not DT_RUNPATH; gate on a load+init smoke test — scripts/mpv-linux — A [git,docs,code]
3. `bundled-native-soname-conflict` — a bundled common lib claims the soname and breaks a *system* API; probe the API before loading the native; real cure is a SYSTEM_LIBS exclusion — CLAUDE.md 2026-07-31 — A [docs,git]
4. `macos-codesign-sidecar-strip` — strip `._*` AppleDouble files before signing or macOS reports "app is damaged" — CLAUDE.md — A [docs,git]

10. `upstream-lib-bug-workaround-template` — how to write a workaround for a bug in a lib you can't patch: named tradeoffs, a graceful escape hatch, an explicit removal condition; usage-pattern (not code) is what exposes it — CLAUDE.md — A [docs,git]
11. `macos-lsenvironment-path-pin` — env via Info.plist pins PATH to the bare four dirs; audit ProcessBuilder first — MEMORY_TUNING.md — A [docs]

## B · Desktop packaging / CI / build (13)
12. `conveyor-desktop-packaging` — HOCON swallows a misplaced key silently; url-schemes binds at AppConfig level; `-K<dotted.key>=<value>` overrides (brackets are for LIST values, not dotted keys; spaced keys need HOCON quoting); per-machine JDK; LSEnvironment PATH — conveyor.conf — A [git,docs,code]

27. `clean-arch-kmp-readiness` — module layers; skip the use-case tier when it's just a repo wrapper; internal repository impls; domain is clean of platform/UI types (it DOES carry persistence annotations across ~23 files — the "no annotations" premise was refuted in verify) — blog:clean-architecture — B [blog,core]
28. `no-use-case-layer-decision` — a mid-size app can drop the interactor tier and keep a clean boundary via interfaces + mapping functions (verified: zero use-cases here) — core/domain — B [core]

## CUT for scope (third-party service mechanics) — generic core salvaged into group L
- YouTube Music / InnerTube response parsing (wrapper renderers, pageType classification, videoType, auth-dependent shapes) → generic core in `structural-defensive-parsing`, `enum-normalize-over-legacy-data`
- YouTube stream extraction (signature/n-param deciphering, the extractor-lifecycle add/remove, SAPISIDHASH auth)
- Last.fm (signature signing, status-ok-but-ignored, web-vs-desktop auth flow) → core in `api-ok-but-ignored`, `oauth-callback-not-through-nav`
- Discord gateway (opcode state machine, rate-limited presence, session hygiene) → core in `retry-needs-backoff-and-cap`, `login-state-fans-out-to-settings`
- Spotify (TOTP derivation, Canvas fuzzy match + protobuf, login-URL matching, cookie handoff)
- Lyrics providers fallback chain; AI provider (BYOK) client; Tidal endpoint resilience + key normalization → `unknown-not-a-valid-score`
- SponsorBlock segment skipping (generic "auto-skip timed segments off the progress flow" could be salvaged if wanted — currently CUT)
- Local↔YouTube playlist sync (setVideoId membership) → generic `two-way-sync-state-machine-delta-diff` kept? (currently folded, mark if wanted)
- Google Cast handoff — BORDERLINE (uses Google SDK); CUT by default, can return as neutral "remote-playback handoff architecture"

## Batch 6 — delta mined 2026-08-24 (76 new · 20 updated)

> Mined from the source project's continued development after the original 140 shipped: 10 write lanes → 10 adversarial verify lanes → 7 fix lanes, same quality bar and the same anonymity rules. Grouped below by mining cluster; the trailing letter is the A–N taxonomy above.

**Shared sessions — bridge, roles and intent (10)**
141. `sync-room-bridge-echo-guard` — one bridge, direction decided by role; a flag held across the apply stops a remote command's local side effect being published straight back — D
142. `play-intent-decided-before-load` — decide whether and where the item starts before building it, instead of loading with a hardcoded "start playing" and correcting a moment later — D
143. `intent-flag-not-observed-state` — a component committed to running still reports "not running"; anything meaning intent reads the intent flag, and waits for it with a timeout rather than sampling inline — D
144. `server-default-overrides-client-intent` — a relay stamps its own default onto fields your command left unset, so a follower obeying it verbatim stops the thing it just loaded — D
145. `position-based-group-sync` — publish the playhead with every command, correct for flight time, seek only past a tolerance — never make everyone wait for the slowest member — D
146. `joiner-catches-up-by-asking` — pushed state is the source's last command replayed, so its position is however old that command is; ask for the live position on arrival — D
147. `follower-transport-stays-local` — a follower owns its own stop button: pausing is local and silent, and resuming asks where the group is now rather than restoring where this device stopped — D
148. `runtime-override-not-preference-write` — disable a feature for the duration of a mode with a runtime override, never by writing the stored preference a process death would make permanent — D
149. `derive-seek-from-progress-flow` — detect a scrub as a playhead that moved further than wall-clock time allows; the platform's own discontinuity callback exists on one backend only — D
150. `follower-item-built-from-shared-payload` — build the follower's item from the payload the session carries, not by re-resolving locally: a shape-based guess picks the wrong rendition and a per-item round trip wedges the collector — D

**Wire protocol, clocks and session lifecycle (7)**
151. `monotonic-clock-offset-sync` — take the peer's processing time out before halving the round trip, weight samples against the best trip seen, and insist the local source is monotonic — L
152. `readiness-barrier-needs-every-answer` — answer a group barrier on bufferedness rather than on playing, answer only when actually named, and accept that one member who never answers freezes everyone — D
153. `protobuf-without-codegen-kmp` — annotate ordinary data classes with field numbers instead of generating a JVM-only code layer; one encoder setting decides whether the bytes match — L
154. `borrowed-wire-protocol-discipline` — a protocol someone else defined is not yours to improve: no renaming, no reordering, omitted constants read off the counterpart, unknown types decoded to null — L
155. `websocket-session-handshake-lifecycle` — reader started before the first message because the answer returns through it, handshake settled on a deferred with a timeout, close frame sent non-cancellable — L
156. `publish-a-snapshot-on-taking-the-role` — every publisher is edge-triggered, so whoever was already running when they took the role emits nothing; publish a full snapshot on becoming the source — L
157. `pending-state-makes-waiting-legible` — model "asked, and not yet answered" as its own field, or a refusal and a peer who never looked are indistinguishable — I

**One curve, two engines — filters, presets and profile import (10)**
158. `filter-chain-two-owners-one-writer` — two features wanting entries in one whole-chain property need per-feature fields, a single writer, and a clear that drops only its own tier — D
159. `identity-compare-immutable-setting` — bundle a multi-field setting into one immutable value behind a supplier, so a hot consumer asks "changed?" once and can never see the fields half-updated — M
160. `sampled-supplier-vs-per-handle-reapply` — one backend samples a shared field per buffer and needs no push; the other starts every handle blank and needs an explicit re-apply at each creation site — D
161. `one-setting-two-backends` — define the centres, width and range once and verify both backends against a reference implementation rather than by ear — D
162. `preset-identity-read-back-from-value` — derive "which preset is this" by comparing against the value in force instead of storing a label, so editing drops to Custom and returning re-selects — I
163. `remote-index-cached-as-rows-with-validator` — parse a large published index into indexed rows once and re-check with the server's own validator; a 200 that parses to nothing is a failure, not a refresh — J
164. `control-range-must-cover-stored-values` — size a slider from the real distribution it will be handed, because an out-of-range value parks the thumb at the end while the readout shows a different number — G
165. `removing-a-feature-audit-shared-handles` — before deleting a feature, audit what else uses the handle it appeared to own, delete the other platforms' no-op stubs, and force-stop before judging the result — N
166. `edit-a-shape-as-a-shape` — when the value is a curve, draw a draggable curve rather than N sliders: raw pointer loop, one commit per gesture, smoothing that never overshoots a placed handle — G
167. `optional-engine-feature-degrade-in-tiers` — an engine rejects the whole chain when one stage is unknown, so retry without the optional stage and report which tiers were accepted — D

**A screen with two looks — shell, content and the rules between them (11)**
168. `screen-shell-content-split` — split a screen into a shell owning every cross-look concern and a content layer that only renders, connected by a state snapshot and an actions bag — H
169. `variant-layout-math-stays-in-the-variant` — keep a fit-one-screen measurement per look instead of hoisting one, and mirror the invisible spacer to the ratio actually drawn — H
170. `hoist-the-flag-not-the-animation` — share the boolean that drives a fade, never the tween that runs it, so one look can go asymmetric without changing how the other feels — G
171. `dont-pre-animate-a-self-animating-property` — a component that animates a property itself ignores new targets mid-flight, so an externally tweened value freezes it part-way — G
172. `progress-indicator-as-scrubber` — build a seek control from an indicator plus a transparent pointer layer: taller hit box, drags consumed so an ancestor pager cannot steal the scrub — G
173. `restricted-marker-is-not-an-opt-in` — tell an opt-in marker from a restricted-to marker before adding suppressions; only the first is compiler-enforced, and both coexist in one library — M
174. `artwork-seeded-dynamic-scheme` — derive a whole tonal scheme from one extracted seed and wrap only that subtree, tweening the seed rather than the scheme — F
175. `a-stated-rule-needs-annotated-exceptions` — a rule with legitimate exceptions rots unless every exception carries its reason at the call site and the rule itself is greppable — N
176. `scoped-composable-shadows-the-top-level-one` — inside a layout scope a same-named scope extension wins silently, so a call written for the plain version gets the scoped one's defaults — G
177. `settings-value-round-tripped-through-its-label` — mapping a chosen localized label back to a stored value breaks the day two labels translate identically; carry the id, and make the miss loud — G
178. `self-hiding-child-cannot-hide-its-slot` — a component that renders nothing cannot remove the container someone else wrapped it in; gate the slot on the same published predicate — G

**Charts that refuse to lie (7)**
179. `self-normalised-axes-need-a-second-shape` — self-normalised axes need one guarded denominator each and a second polygon, because a lone shape on them says nothing — G
180. `dont-slice-one-circle-between-unrelated-measures` — measures sharing no whole go on concentric arcs, capped short of 360°, drawn over a full-ring track — G
181. `delta-absent-not-infinite` — render a change against an empty baseline as nothing at all: never +100%, never an infinity, never a saturated integer — G
182. `partial-chart-must-say-so` — print the share of input the distribution could classify, computed with the same predicates that built the buckets, and keep that line reachable at zero coverage — G
183. `equal-buckets-or-no-buckets` — buckets of exactly equal width with the remainder falling outside; a partial newest bucket must never be drawn at full width — G
184. `mosaic-arrangements-must-be-hole-free` — a ranked mosaic needs an arm for every count, so no entry is silently dropped and no arrangement leaves an empty rectangle — G
185. `empty-state-must-keep-its-navigation` — replacing a populated header with an empty-state message must not delete the controls that header owned, or the user cannot get back out — H

**Time, windows and shares in the query layer (8)**
186. `stored-timestamp-is-a-local-wall-clock` — a converter-written timestamp can hold local time encoded as UTC; declaring a projection field as a raw number opts out of the converter and applies the offset twice — E
187. `bucket-local-time-in-code-not-in-sql` — the engine's local-time modifier answers from the process time zone, and four local-time aggregates mean four scans that can disagree — E
188. `one-snapshot-per-period-not-many-flows` — return a period's figures as one immutable snapshot from a single suspend call; separate emissions let this period's count render beside last period's total — I
189. `unbounded-for-shares-capped-for-lists` — a top-N query is right for a list and wrong for a share of the whole, because the cut tail shrinks the denominator invisibly — E
190. `first-ever-not-first-in-window` — take MIN over the entity's whole history and ask whether it lands inside the window; filtering first and grouping after calls every entity new — E
191. `palette-state-parks-on-loading` — a generator that flips to Loading before its own suspension point reports no colour for the whole generation, and a cancelled one never restarts — F
192. `string-resource-format-limits` — the multiplatform formatter substitutes plain positional placeholders and nothing else, so padding, rounding and units belong in code — M
193. `inclusive-period-boundaries-and-offset-reset` — hold one boundary convention everywhere, and reset the step offset whenever the granularity changes — E

**Effects, indication and transitions (8)**
194. `event-not-state-edge-for-one-shot-effects` — fire a one-shot effect from the click that caused it; an effect watching a boolean edge cannot tell a tap from data arriving a beat later — G
195. `draw-outside-bounds-particle-modifier` — draw modifiers are unclipped by default, so the modifier must sit before every clip in the chain, and reach scales off the host's measured size — G
196. `image-fallback-url-retry-in-composition` — hold the URL in composition state and swap it once in onError; the cache key must follow the mutated URL and the swap must be a no-op the second time — G
197. `text-brush-shimmer-sweep` — put the moving gradient on the text style itself so glyphs are painted by the brush; declare the infinite transition unconditionally or it restarts on every appearance — G
198. `touch-indication-bounds-and-alpha` — soften a ripple by alpha alone and give it the right bounds; clip must precede clickable, and a card and its clip need one shape value — G
199. `crossfade-container-sizes-to-the-visible-child` — the container is a top-start Box sized to the largest composed child, so a thin child pins to the top mid-transition and drops when the tall one leaves — G
200. `slide-transition-defaults-to-half-a-height` — a vertical slide defaults to half the element's height, so it starts already halfway and reads as a pop — G
201. `transparent-chip-selection-signals` — a shadow under a transparent shape shows through as a dark ring, and zeroing resting elevation does not remove it: each interaction state carries its own token — G

**Measurement, insets and commit points (5)**
202. `weight-fill-false-to-center-a-cluster` — a weighted child occupies its whole slot even when narrower, pinning its sibling to the far edge; releasing the unused width is two edits, not one — G
203. `stacked-bars-double-consume-window-insets` — inset consumption reaches descendants and never siblings, so two stacked inset-aware bars each reserve the system bar — H
204. `lazy-item-grouping-beats-arrangement-gap` — a list's spacing applies between every pair and compounds with each item's own padding, so a block that reads as one unit belongs in one item — G
205. `floating-overlay-reserves-its-own-strip` — a floated control takes part in no measurement, so every scrolling branch must reserve the strip it covers explicitly — H
206. `commit-a-text-field-on-an-explicit-action` — writing on focus loss stores whatever was half-typed when a dialog or a stray tap took focus; keep the draft keyed on the stored value — G

**Theming a shell that is not the default (5)**
207. `gate-optional-effect-at-the-shared-primitive` — put the on/off setting inside the one primitive that draws the effect; the off path keeps the shape and hit target and changes only the paint — F
208. `shell-background-is-not-scheme-background` — the moment panels stop using the scheme background, every gradient and scrim converging on it ends on a hard seam — F
209. `flat-twin-shares-geometry-not-material` — when a setting picks between an expensive rendering and a plain twin, every geometry decision must be mirrored: the compiler cannot pair two constants in two files — F
210. `chrome-drawn-outside-the-theme-scope` — a title bar, splash or crash dialog composed as a sibling of the theme reads the framework default scheme, light always, and nothing errors — F
211. `ambient-tone-layer-behind-flat-pages` — a reusable top-glow emitted as the first sibling of a destination's content; a null tone must collapse into the page colour, not substitute a theme colour — F

**Platform surfaces and data-layer reach (5)**
212. `two-vendors-one-package-kmp-api-skew` — two vendors shipping one package name at different versions into different source sets make an import that compiles for one target and fails for the other — C
213. `remoteviews-bitmap-budget` — every bitmap crosses a process boundary against a fixed budget, so decoding at draw size is what keeps the widget on screen, not an optimisation — K
214. `glance-layout-vocabulary` — the widget toolkit has no aspect ratio, weight is always 1, corner radius applies only from a later API, and the cell's spare height must be spent deliberately — K
215. `search-over-a-paged-list-queries-the-source` — filtering a paging stream only searches the pages already loaded; the search must query the store and render as a sibling overlay — J
216. `mirror-local-state-to-a-remote-account` — an opt-in mirror back-fills on enable, deliberately does not undo on disable, and reports three values so "not attempted" differs from "failed" — J

## Batch 7 — delta mined 2026-08-29 from the v2.0.0 release sprint (8 new · 9 updated)

> Window: app repo `21918e51..v2.0.0`, core submodule `4892ea9..8db86c9`. Pipeline: 4 write lanes, 2 adversarial verify lanes (28 findings, all repaired and re-verified), 2 fix lanes.

**Word-timed lyrics and transliteration (3)**
217. `word-timed-karaoke-lyrics` — per-word start times with ends inferred from the next word, a wall-clock wipe re-derived from discrete state so a backward seek cannot strand it, glow via shadow colour not alpha, pre-roll ordered before the active-line arm — G
218. `script-aware-romanization-pipeline` — per-line script detection by proof not count, same-block language disambiguation by most-distinctive letters first, and the two dictionary-backed scripts being exactly the two properties a per-character table cannot express — M
219. `combining-chars-break-char-literals` — a decomposed combining mark makes one visible letter two `Char`s, so it can be neither a char literal nor a per-`Char` map key; the stdlib answers the category question in common code but not grapheme segmentation — M

**Capture, reel and state seeding (3)**
220. `compose-capture-to-share-image` — record a subtree's draw into a graphics layer through a buffered channel, capture only already-resolved images, and keep the permission-free save path separate from the cache-and-share path — G
221. `story-reel-auto-pager` — a frame-delta timer gated on press, busy and scroll at once; an empty long-press lambda that is load-bearing; the target page for tap decisions versus the settled page for display; every slide precomputed before the pager mounts — G
222. `derive-the-flag-dont-store-and-correct-it` — a derived boolean stored in saveable state and corrected one frame later by an effect flashes on entry; derive it in composition from the data it depends on — I

**Optional assets and hidden capability (2)**
223. `on-demand-dictionary-asset` — ship a heavy optional asset as a staged, digest-checked, whitelist-extracted on-demand download that gates its feature until ready; a lazy that caches a returned null never retries — K
224. `hidden-setting-does-not-clear-the-stored-value` — hiding a picker does not clear what it already stored, so every render site re-derives preference-and-capability itself; an effect that silently no-ops on older devices needs a positive capability boolean — G

**Updated in batch 7 (9):** `playback-position-persist-restore` · `forwarding-player-hot-swap` · `queue-index-vs-shuffle-space` · `glance-layout-vocabulary` · `conveyor-desktop-packaging` · `bundled-native-soname-conflict` · `local-listening-analytics` · `structural-defensive-parsing` · `intent-flag-not-observed-state`
